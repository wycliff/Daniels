		Among the children of Israel who were carried captive 
		to Babylon at the beginning of the seventy
years' captivity were Christian patriots, men who were as true
 as steel to principle, who would not be
corrupted by selfishness, but who would honor God at the loss of
 all things. In the land of their
captivity these men were to carry out God's purpose by giving to 
heathen nations the blessings that
come through a knowledge of Jehovah. They were to be His representatives.
 Never were they to
compromise with idolaters; their faith and their name as worshipers of the 
living God they were to bear as a high honor. And this they did. In prosperity
 and adversity  they honored God, and God honored them.
The fact that these men, worshipers of Jehovah, were captives in Babylon, and that the 
vessels of God's house had been placed in the Temple of the Babylonish gods,
 was boastfully cited by the victors as evidence that their religion


and customs were superior to the religion and customs of the Hebrews.
 Yet through the very humiliations that Israel's departure from Him had invited, God gave Babylon 
evidence of His supremacy, of the holiness of His requirements, and of the sure results of obedience. And this
testimony He gave, as alone it could be given, through those who were loyal to Him.
Among those who maintained their allegiance to God were Daniel and his three companions--
illustrious examples of what men may become who unite with the God of wisdom and power. From the
comparative simplicity of their Jewish home, these youth of royal line were taken to the most
magnificent of cities and into the court of the world's greatest monarch. Nebuchadnezzar "spake unto
Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the
king's seed, and of the princes; children in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skillful in all
wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to
stand in the king's palace. . . .
"Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. " Seeing in
these youth the promise of remarkable ability, Nebuchadnezzar determined that they should be trained
to fill important positions in his kingdom. That they might be fully qualified for their lifework, he
arranged for them to learn the language of the Chaldeans and for three years to be granted the unusual
educational advantages afforded princess of the realm.
The names of Daniel and his companions were changed to names representing Chaldean deities.~  Ellen G White

		Great significance was attached to the names given by Hebrew
parents to their children. Often these stood for traits of character that the parent desired to see
developed in the child. The prince in whose charge the captive youth were placed, "gave unto Daniel
the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah,
of Abednego."
The king did not compel the Hebrew youth to renounce their faith in favor of idolatry, but he hoped to
bring this about gradually. By giving them names significant of idolatry, by bringing them daily into
close association with idolatrous customs, and under the influence of the seductive rites of heathen
worship, he hoped to induce them to renounce the religion of their nation and to unite with the worship
of the Babylonians.
At the very outset of their career there came to them a decisive test of character. It was provided that
they should eat of the food and drink of the wine that came from the king's table. In this the king
thought to give them an expression of his favor and of his solicitude for their welfare. But a portion
having been offered to idols, the food from the king's table was consecrated to idolatry; and one
partaking of it would be regarded as offering homage to the gods of Babylon. In such homage, loyalty
to Jehovah forbade Daniel and his companions to join. Even a mere pretense of eating the food or
drinking the wine would be a denial of their faith. To do this would be to array themselves with
heathenism and to dishonour the principles of the law of God.~ Ellen G White
