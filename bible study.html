	<h3> Bible Study</h3>
	<br>
	<h2> THE WORD IS A LAMP UNTO MY FEET,<br>
	AND A LIGHT UNTO MY PATH -Psalms 119:105</h2>

	 God desires man to exercise his reasoning powers;<br>
	 and the study of the Bible will strengthen and elevate<br>
	 the mind as no other study can.~ Ellen G White

	Such wonderful things are presented in the pages of Holy writ, may we not neglect these life changing truths truly:
	"And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus
 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness
 That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works." 2nd Tim 3:15-17<br>
 "For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope."Rom 15:4
 and finally may we be doers of the word not only hearing it and casting it aside  "But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. <br>
 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: 
 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. 
 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer,
 but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed "James 1:23-25.
